# Sudoku Game React Component

**Project Description:**
This is a React and TypeScript application that brings the classic Sudoku puzzle to the browser. It allows users to generate valid Sudoku puzzles at three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) using a backtracking algorithm, fill in numbers with real-time conflict detection, request hints, and even solve the puzzle automatically. Additionally, the app includes an optional image-based solver: users can upload a photo of a printed Sudoku, which is processed via OCR to populate the grid and solved within the UI.

# Sudoku Game React Component

This project implements a  Sudoku game in React and TypeScript. It features:

* **Interactive Board**: A 9×9 Sudoku grid that users can fill manually.
* **Real‐time Conflict Detection**: Highlights cells that violate Sudoku rules (duplicate in row, column, or 3×3 box).
* **Random Puzzle Generator**: Generates a complete, valid Sudoku solution using a backtracking algorithm, then removes numbers to create a puzzle.
* **Difficulty Levels**: Easy, Medium, and Hard modes that control how many cells are blanked out.
* **Controls**:

  * **Radio Buttons**: Select difficulty and automatically generate a new puzzle.
  * **Clear Board**: Reset all cells  not generated by the game to empty.
  * **Check Solution**: Validate the current board and report if there are mistakes.

## Usage

1. **Select Difficulty** using the radio buttons: Easy, Medium, or Hard.
2. **Generate Puzzle**: A new Sudoku puzzle is created automatically after selecting a difficulty.
3. **Fill the Board**: Click on any empty cell and enter a digit (1–9).
4. **Conflict Highlighting**: Any invalid entry (duplicate in the same row/column/3×3 block) will be marked.
5. **Check Solution**: Click “Check solution” to verify if the entire board is solved correctly.



## Key Components

### GameLogic

* **State**:

  * `board: string[][]` — the current 9×9 grid state.
  * `difficulty: "easy" | "medium" | "hard"` — selected difficulty level.

* **Functions**:

  * `hasConflict(row, col, value, board)` — checks for duplicates in the row, column, and 3×3 block.
  * `fillCell(pos)` — a recursive backtracking function that fills the entire board with a valid solution.
  * `generateRandomBoard()` — calls `fillCell`, then blanks out cells based on difficulty.
  * `clearBoard()` — resets the board to all empty strings.
  * `isBoardValid()` — verifies that every cell is non-empty and conflict-free.
  * `setDifficulty(level, board)` — removes a number of cells to create a puzzle for the chosen difficulty.

### Boards

* Renders the 9×9 grid using a nested array map.
* Each cell is an `<input>` with:

  * `value` bound to `board[row][col]`.
  * `onChange` event to update its state.
  * Dynamic class names to highlight thick borders (3×3 blocks) and conflicts.

## Algorithm Details

### Backtracking Generator

1. **Empty Board**: Start with a 9×9 array of empty strings.
2. **Shuffle Digits**: Randomize the array `['1',…,'9']` for each cell (Fisher–Yates shuffle).
3. **Recursive Fill**:

   * Place a candidate digit if it doesn’t conflict.
   * Recurse to the next cell (`pos + 1`).
   * If stuck, clear the cell and backtrack.
4. **Puzzle Creation**: After obtaining a full valid solution, blank out `n` cells according to the difficulty level.

## Customization

* **Adjust Difficulty**: Modify the blank counts in `SetDifficulty`:

  ```ts
  switch (dif) {
    case 'easy': d = 20; break;
    case 'medium': d = 35; break;
    case 'hard': d = 65; break;
  }
  and also each level has its number of hints easy:0 and so one 
  ```
* **Styling**: Update CSS classes in `sudoku-cell`, `border‑*-bold`, and `conflict-cell` to change appearance and some animations i've learned it on the youtube.
